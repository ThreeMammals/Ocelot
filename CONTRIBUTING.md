We love to receive contributions from the community so please keep them coming :) 

Pull requests, issues and commentary welcome!

Please complete the relavent template for issues and PRs. Sometimes it's worth getting in touch with us to discuss changes 
before doing any work incase this is something we are already doing or it might not make sense. We can also give
advice on the easiest way to do things :)

Finally we mark all existing issues as help wanted, small, medium and large effort. If you want to contriute for the first time I suggest looking at a help wanted & small effort issue :)
