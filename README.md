# Ocelot

Ocelot is a .NET API Gateway. This project is aimed at people using .NET running 
a micro services / service oriented architecture 
that need a unified point of entry into their system. However it will work with anything that speaks HTTP and run on any platform that ASP.NET Core supports.

In particular I want easy integration with 
IdentityServer reference and bearer tokens. 

We have been unable to find this in my current workplace
without having to write our own Javascript middlewares 
to handle the IdentityServer reference tokens. We would
rather use the IdentityServer code that already exists
to do this.

Ocelot is a bunch of middlewares in a specific order.

Ocelot manipulates the HttpRequest object into a state specified by its configuration until 
it reaches a request builder middleware where it creates a HttpRequestMessage object which is 
used to make a request to a downstream service. The middleware that makes the request is 
the last thing in the Ocelot pipeline. It does not call the next middleware. 
The response from the downstream service is retrieved as the requests goes back up the Ocelot pipeline. 
There is a piece of middleware that maps the HttpResponseMessage onto the HttpResponse object and that 
is returned to the client. That is basically it with a bunch of other features!

## How to install

Ocelot is designed to work with ASP.NET Core only and it targets `netstandard2.0`. This means it can be used anywhere `.NET Standard 2.0` is supported, including `.NET Core 2.1` and `.NET Framework 4.7.2` and up. [This](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) documentation may prove helpful when working out if Ocelot would be suitable for you.

Install Ocelot and it's dependencies using NuGet. 

`Install-Package Ocelot`

Or via the .NET Core CLI:

`dotnet add package ocelot`

All versions can be found [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ocelot/)
