-------------------------------------

.. _OpenTracing: https://opentracing.io

  | Package: `Ocelot.Tracing.OpenTracing <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ocelot.Tracing.OpenTracing>`_
  | Namespace: ``Ocelot.Tracing.OpenTracing``

Ocelot provides tracing functionality through the excellent project from `opentracing-csharp <https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-csharp>`_ repository.
The code for Ocelot integration can be found in this `Ocelot project <https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/tree/main/src/Ocelot.Tracing.OpenTracing>`_.

The example below uses the `C# Client for Jaeger <https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-csharp>`_ to provide the tracer used in Ocelot.
To add `OpenTracing`_ services, you must call the ``AddOpenTracing()`` extension method on the ``OcelotBuilder`` returned by ``AddOcelot()`` [#f1]_, as shown below:

.. code-block:: csharp
  :emphasize-lines: 11

  builder.Services
      .AddSingleton(serviceProvider =>
      {
          var loggerFactory = serviceProvider.GetService<ILoggerFactory>();
          var config = new Jaeger.Configuration(builder.Environment.ApplicationName, loggerFactory);
          var tracer = config.GetTracer();
          GlobalTracer.Register(tracer);
          return tracer;
      })
      .AddOcelot(builder.Configuration)
      .AddOpenTracing();

Then, in your `ocelot.json <https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/blob/main/samples/OpenTracing/ocelot.json>`__, add the following to the route you want to trace:

.. code-block:: json

  "HttpHandlerOptions": {
    "UseTracing": true
  }

Ocelot will now send tracing information to `Jaeger <https://www.jaegertracing.io/>`_ whenever this route is called.

  **Note 1**: A clean yet functional sample can be found here: `Ocelot.Samples.OpenTracing <https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/tree/main/samples/OpenTracing>`_.

  **Note 2**: The `OpenTracing`_ project was archived on January 31, 2022 (see `the article <https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/01/31/cncf-archives-the-opentracing-project/>`_).
  The Ocelot team is planning to decide on a migration to `OpenTelemetry <https://opentelemetry.io>`_, which is highly desirable.

Butterfly

.. _Butterfly: https://github.com/liuhaoyang/butterfly

  | Package: `Ocelot.Tracing.Butterfly <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ocelot.Tracing.Butterfly>`_
  | Namespace: ``Ocelot.Tracing.Butterfly``

Ocelot provides tracing functionality through the excellent `Butterfly`_ project.
The code for the Ocelot integration can be found in this `Ocelot project <https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/tree/main/src/Ocelot.Tracing.Butterfly>`__.
To use the tracing functionality, please refer to the `Butterfly`_ documentation.

In Ocelot, you need to add the NuGet package if you wish to trace a route:

.. code-block:: powershell

    Install-Package Ocelot.Tracing.Butterfly

In your `Program`_, to add `Butterfly`_ services, you must call the ``AddButterfly()`` extension method on the ``OcelotBuilder`` returned by ``AddOcelot()``, as shown below:

.. code-block:: csharp
  :emphasize-lines: 5

  using Ocelot.Tracing.Butterfly;

  builder.Services
      .AddOcelot(builder.Configuration)
      .AddButterfly(options =>
      {
          // This is the URL that the Butterfly collector server is running on...
          options.CollectorUrl = "http://localhost:9618";
          options.Service = "Ocelot";
      });

Then, in your `ocelot.json`_, add the following to the route you want to trace:

.. code-block:: json

  "HttpHandlerOptions": {
    "UseTracing": true
  }

Ocelot will now send tracing information to `Butterfly`_ whenever this route is called.

  **Note**: The `Butterfly`_ project has not been supported for more than seven years, as of 2025.
  The latest release of the `Butterfly.Client <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Butterfly.Client>`_ package (version `0.0.8 <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Butterfly.Client/0.0.8>`_) was made on February 22, 2018.
  The Ocelot team is planning to discontinue the `Ocelot.Tracing.Butterfly`_ package, which is scheduled to happen after the release of Ocelot version `24.0`_.
