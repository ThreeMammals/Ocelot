Ocelot `24.0`_
##############

Thanks for taking a look at the Ocelot documentation!
Please use the left hand **Navigation** sidebar to get around, or see the :htm:`<a class="reference internal" href="#toc"><span class="std std-ref">Table of Contents</span></a> below.` :pdf:`\textbf{Table of Contents} above.`

The team recommends that newcomers to Ocelot's world start with the **Introduction** chapters.
For seasoned fans of Ocelot with a Production environment, it is advised to always consult the :ref:`release-notes` in the **Welcome** section before upgrading the app to the latest `24.0`_ version.

All **Features** are listed in alphabetical order.
The primary features include :doc:`../features/configuration` and :doc:`../features/routing`.

Additional tips for building Ocelot can be found in the **Building Ocelot** section.
We adhere to a :doc:`../building/devprocess` which is a part of :doc:`../building/releaseprocess`.
