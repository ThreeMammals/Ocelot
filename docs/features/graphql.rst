======================

Ocelot doesn't directly support `GraphQL <https://graphql.org/>`_, but so many people have asked about it.
We wanted to show how easy it is to integrate the `GraphQL for .NET <https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet>`_ library. 


Please see the sample project `OcelotGraphQL <https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/tree/main/samples/OcelotGraphQL>`_.
Using a combination of the `graphql-dotnet <https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet>`_ project and Ocelot :doc:`../features/delegatinghandlers` features, this is pretty easy to do. 
However we do not intend to integrate more closely with **GraphQL** at the moment.
Check out the samples `README.md <https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/blob/main/samples/OcelotGraphQL/README.md>`_ and that should give you enough instruction on how to do this!

Future
------

If you have sufficient experience with GraphQL and mentioned .NET `package <https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet>`_, we would welcome your contribution to the sample. |octocat|

Who knows, maybe you'll get inspired by the sample development and come up with some design solution in the form of a rough draft of GraphQL feature to implement in Ocelot.
Good luck!

And, welcome to `Discussions <https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/discussions>`_ space of the repository!
