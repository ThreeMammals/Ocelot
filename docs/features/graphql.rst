======================

Ocelot does not directly support `GraphQL`_, but many people have asked about it.
We wanted to show how easy it is to integrate the `GraphQL for .NET <https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet>`_ library.

Sample
------

  **Sample**: `Ocelot.Samples.GraphQL`_

Please see the sample project `Ocelot.Samples.GraphQL`_.
Using a combination of the `graphql-dotnet`_ project and Ocelot :doc:`../features/delegatinghandlers` feature, this is pretty easy to do.
However, we do not intend to integrate more closely with `GraphQL`_ at the moment.
Check out the sample's `README.md <https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/blob/main/samples/GraphQL/README.md>`_ for detailed instructions on how to do this.

Future
------

If you have sufficient experience with `GraphQL`_ and the mentioned .NET `graphql-dotnet`_ package, we would welcome your contribution to the sample. |octocat|

Who knows, maybe youâ€™ll get inspired by the sample development and come up with a design solution in the form of a rough draft of a *GraphQL* feature to implement in Ocelot.
Good luck!
And welcome to the `Discussions <https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/discussions>`_ space of the repository!
