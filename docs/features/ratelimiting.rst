Ocelot Own Implementation
-------------------------

Ocelot provides *rate limiting* for upstream requests to prevent downstream services from becoming overwhelmed. [#f1]_

Rate Limit by Client's Header
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To implement *rate limiting* for a Route, you need to incorporate the following JSON configuration:

.. code-block:: json

  "RateLimitOptions": {
    "ClientWhitelist": [], // array of strings
    "EnableRateLimiting": true,
    "Period": "1s", // seconds, minutes, hours, days
    "PeriodTimespan": 1, // only seconds
    "Limit": 1
  }

* **ClientWhitelist** - An array containing the whitelisted clients. Clients listed here will be exempt from rate limiting.
  For more information on the **ClientIdHeader** option, refer to the :ref:`rl-global-configuration` section.
* **EnableRateLimiting** - This setting enables rate limiting on endpoints.
* **Period** - This parameter defines the duration for which the limit is applicable, such as ``1s`` (seconds), ``5m`` (minutes), ``1h`` (hours), and ``1d`` (days).
  If you reach the exact **Limit** of requests, the excess occurs immediately, and the **PeriodTimespan** begins.
  You must wait for the **PeriodTimespan** duration to pass before making another request.
  Should you exceed the number of requests within the period more than the **Limit** permits, the **QuotaExceededMessage** will appear in the response, accompanied by the **HttpStatusCode**.
* **PeriodTimespan** - This parameter indicates the time in **seconds** after which a retry is permissible.
  During this interval, the **QuotaExceededMessage** will appear in the response, accompanied by an **HttpStatusCode**.
  Clients are advised to consult the ``Retry-After`` header to determine the timing of subsequent requests.
* **Limit** - This parameter defines the upper limit of requests a client is allowed to make within a specified **Period**.

.. _rl-global-configuration:

Global Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can set the following in the ``GlobalConfiguration`` section of `ocelot.json`_:

.. code-block:: json

  "GlobalConfiguration": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://api.mybusiness.com",
    "RateLimitOptions": {
      "DisableRateLimitHeaders": false,
      "QuotaExceededMessage": "Customize Tips!",
      "HttpStatusCode": 418, // I'm a teapot
      "ClientIdHeader": "MyRateLimiting"
    }
  }

* **DisableRateLimitHeaders** - Determines if the ``X-Rate-Limit`` and ``Retry-After`` headers are disabled.
* **QuotaExceededMessage** - Defines the message displayed when the quota is exceeded. It is optional and the default message is informative.
* **HttpStatusCode** - Indicates the HTTP status code returned during *rate limiting*. The default value is **429** (`Too Many Requests`_).
* **ClientIdHeader** - Specifies the header used to identify clients, with ``ClientId`` as the default.

Future and ASP.NET Core Implementation
--------------------------------------

The Ocelot team is contemplating a redesign of the *Rate Limiting* feature following the `Announcing Rate Limiting for .NET`_ by Brennan Conroy on July 13th, 2022.
Currently, no decision has been made, and the previous version of the feature remains part of the `20.0`_ release for .NET 7. [#f2]_

Discover the new features being introduced in the ASP.NET Core 7.0 release:

* The `RateLimiter Class <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.ratelimiting.ratelimiter>`_, available since ASP.NET Core 7.0
* The `System.Threading.RateLimiting <https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Threading.RateLimiting>`_ NuGet package
* The `Rate limiting middleware in ASP.NET Core <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/rate-limit>`_ article by Arvin Kahbazi, Maarten Balliauw, and Rick Anderson

While retaining the old implementation as an Ocelot built-in feature makes sense, we plan to transition to the new Rate Limiter from the ``Microsoft.AspNetCore.RateLimiting`` namespace.

.. [#f1] Historically, the *"Ocelot Own Rate Limiting"* feature is one of the oldest and first features of Ocelot. This feature was delivered in PR `37`_ by `@geffzhang`_ on GitHub. Many thanks! It was initially released in version `1.3.2`_. The authors were inspired by `@catcherwong article`_ to write this documentation.
.. [#f2] Since PR `37`_ and version `1.3.2`_, the Ocelot team has reviewed and redesigned the feature to provide stable behavior. The fix for bug `1590`_ (PR `1592`_) was released as part of version `23.3`_.
