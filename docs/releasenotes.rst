‚ÑπÔ∏è About
^^^^^^^^^

This minor release significantly upgrades the :doc:`../features/routing` feature by supporting :ref:`routing-embedded-placeholders` within path segments (between slashes).
Additionally, the team has focused on enhancing the performance of ``Regex`` objects.

üÜï What's New?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :doc:`../features/routing`: Introducing the new ":ref:`routing-embedded-placeholders`" feature by `@ggnaegi`_.

  | As of November 2024, Ocelot was unable to process multiple :ref:`routing-placeholders` embedded between two forward slashes (``/``). It was also challenging to differentiate the placeholder from other elements within the slashes. For example, ``/{url}-2/`` for ``/y-2/`` would yield ``{url} = y-2``. We are excited to introduce an enhanced method for evaluating placeholders that allows for the resolution of :ref:`routing-placeholders` within complex URLs.
  | For additional information, refer to PR `2200`_.

üÜô Feature Updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _Best Practices for Regular Expressions in .NET: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/best-practices
.. _RateLimitingHeaders: https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/blob/main/src/Ocelot/RateLimiting/RateLimitingHeaders.cs
.. _Ocelot's RateLimiting headers do not align with industry standards: https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/blob/27d3df2d0fdfbf5acde12d9442dfc08836e8b982/src/Ocelot/RateLimiting/RateLimitingHeaders.cs#L6
.. _ClaimsToHeadersMiddleware: https://ocelot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/search.html?q=ClaimsToHeadersMiddleware

- :doc:`../features/routing`: The new feature is ":ref:`routing-embedded-placeholders`" by `@ggnaegi`_.

- `Core <https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/labels/Core>`_: All ``Regex`` logic has been refactored by `@EngRajabi`_.

  The Ocelot Core now boasts improved performance of ``Regex`` objects, striving to adhere to the `Best Practices for Regular Expressions in .NET`_.
  It is estimated that each request could save from 1 to over 10 microseconds in processing time (though **no** benchmarks have been developed to measure this).

- :doc:`../features/ratelimiting`: The persistent issue with *Rate Limiting* headers has been resolved by `@jlukawska`_.

  | The problem was the absence of unofficial ``X-Rate-Limit-*`` headers (found in the `RateLimitingHeaders`_ class) in the ``RateLimitingMiddleware``'s response.
  | For more details, see PR `1307`_.
  | Note that these unofficial headers have not yet been documented, so they may be subject to change since `Ocelot's RateLimiting headers do not align with industry standards`_.

- :doc:`../features/middlewareinjection`: The ``ClaimsToHeadersMiddleware`` property has been introduced by `@kesskalli`_.

  This new property of the ``OcelotPipelineConfiguration`` class enables the overriding of the `ClaimsToHeadersMiddleware`_.
  For additional information, refer to PR `1403`_.

üìò Documentation Summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :doc:`../features/routing`: New section on :ref:`routing-embedded-placeholders`.
- :doc:`../features/middlewareinjection`: Added the `ClaimsToHeadersMiddleware`_ property.
