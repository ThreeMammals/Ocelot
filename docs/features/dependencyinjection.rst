Dependency Injection
====================

    | **Namespace**: `Ocelot.DependencyInjection <https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AThreeMammals%2FOcelot+namespace+Ocelot.DependencyInjection&type=code>`_
    | **Source code**: `DependencyInjection <https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/tree/develop/src/Ocelot/DependencyInjection>`_

Overview
--------

| Dependency Injection feature in Ocelot is designed to extend and/or control building of Ocelot core as ASP.NET MVC pipeline services.
| The main methods of the `ServiceCollectionExtensions`_ class are:

* `AddOcelot`_ adds required Ocelot services to DI and it adds default services using `AddDefaultAspNetServices`_ method. 
* `AddOcelotUsingBuilder`_ adds required Ocelot services to DI, and **it adds custom ASP.NET services** with configuration injected implicitly or explicitly.

Use :ref:`di-service-extensions` in in the following ``ConfigureServices`` method (**Program.cs** and **Startup.cs**) of your ASP.NET MVC gateway app (minimal web app) to add/build Ocelot pipeline services:

.. code-block:: csharp

    namespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
    public interface IWebHostBuilder
    {
        IWebHostBuilder ConfigureServices(Action<IServiceCollection> configureServices);
    }

The fact is, the `OcelotBuilder`_ class is Ocelot's cornerstone logic.

.. _di-service-extensions:

``IServiceCollection`` extensions
---------------------------------

    | **Namespace**: ``Ocelot.DependencyInjection``
    | **Class**: `ServiceCollectionExtensions`_

Based on the current implementations for the `OcelotBuilder`_ class, the `AddOcelot`_ method adds required ASP.NET services to DI container.
You could call another more extended `AddOcelotUsingBuilder`_ method while configuring services to build and use custom builder via an ``IMvcCoreBuilder`` object.

.. _di-the-addocelot-method:

The ``AddOcelot`` method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Signatures**:

.. code-block:: csharp

    IOcelotBuilder AddOcelot(this IServiceCollection services);
    IOcelotBuilder AddOcelot(this IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration);

These ``IServiceCollection`` extension methods add default ASP.NET services and Ocelot application services with configuration injected implicitly or explicitly.

**Note!** Both methods add required and **default** ASP.NET services for Ocelot pipeline in the `AddDefaultAspNetServices`_ method which is default builder.

In this scenario, you do nothing other than call the ``AddOcelot`` method, which is often mentioned in feature chapters, if additional startup settings are required.
With this method, you simply reuse the default settings to build the Ocelot pipeline. The alternative is ``AddOcelotUsingBuilder`` method, see the next subsection.

.. _di-addocelotusingbuilder-method:

``AddOcelotUsingBuilder`` method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Signatures**:

.. code-block:: csharp

    using CustomBuilderFunc = System.Func<IMvcCoreBuilder, Assembly, IMvcCoreBuilder>;

    IOcelotBuilder AddOcelotUsingBuilder(this IServiceCollection services, CustomBuilderFunc customBuilder);
    IOcelotBuilder AddOcelotUsingBuilder(this IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration, CustomBuilderFunc customBuilder);

These ``IServiceCollection`` extension methods add Ocelot application services, and they add **custom ASP.NET services** with configuration injected implicitly or explicitly.

**Note!** The method adds **custom** ASP.NET services required for Ocelot pipeline using custom builder (aka ``customBuilder`` parameter).
It is highly recommended to read docs of the `AddDefaultAspNetServices`_ method, 
or even to review implementation to understand default ASP.NET services which are the minimal part of the gateway pipeline. 

In this custom scenario, you control everything during ASP.NET MVC pipeline building, and you provide custom settings to build Ocelot pipeline.

``OcelotBuilder`` class
-----------------------

    **Source code**: `Ocelot.DependencyInjection.OcelotBuilder <https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/blob/develop/src/Ocelot/DependencyInjection/OcelotBuilder.cs>`_

The ``OcelotBuilder`` class is the core of Ocelot which does the following:

- Contructs itself by single public constructor:

  .. code-block:: csharp

    public OcelotBuilder(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configurationRoot, Func<IMvcCoreBuilder, Assembly, IMvcCoreBuilder> customBuilder = null);

- Initializes and stores public properties: **Services** (``IServiceCollection`` object), **Configuration** (``IConfiguration`` object) and **MvcCoreBuilder** (``IMvcCoreBuilder`` object)
- Adds **all application services** during construction phase over the ``Services`` property
- Adds ASP.NET services by builder using ``Func<IMvcCoreBuilder, Assembly, IMvcCoreBuilder>`` object in these 2 development scenarios:

  * by default builder (``AddDefaultAspNetServices`` method) if there is no ``customBuilder`` parameter provided
  * by custom builder with provided delegate object as the ``customBuilder`` parameter

- Adds (switches on/off) Ocelot features by:

  * ``AddSingletonDefinedAggregator`` and ``AddTransientDefinedAggregator`` methods
  * ``AddCustomLoadBalancer`` method
  * ``AddDelegatingHandler`` method
  * ``AddConfigPlaceholders`` method

``AddDefaultAspNetServices`` method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    **Class**: `OcelotBuilder`_

Currently the method is protected and overriding is forbidden.
The role of the method is to inject required services via both ``IServiceCollection`` and ``IMvcCoreBuilder`` interface objects for the minimal part of the gateway pipeline.

Current `implementation <https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AThreeMammals%2FOcelot+AddDefaultAspNetServices+language%3AC%23&type=code&l=C%23>`_ is the folowing:

.. code-block:: csharp

        protected IMvcCoreBuilder AddDefaultAspNetServices(IMvcCoreBuilder builder, Assembly assembly)
        {
            Services
                .AddLogging()
                .AddMiddlewareAnalysis()
                .AddWebEncoders();

            return builder
                .AddApplicationPart(assembly)
                .AddControllersAsServices()
                .AddAuthorization()
                .AddJsonOptions(op =>
                {
                    op.JsonSerializerOptions.ReferenceHandler = ReferenceHandler.IgnoreCycles;
                    op.JsonSerializerOptions.NumberHandling = JsonNumberHandling.AllowReadingFromString;
                    op.JsonSerializerOptions.WriteIndented = false;
                    op.JsonSerializerOptions.PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true;
                    op.JsonSerializerOptions.Encoder = JavaScriptEncoder.Create(UnicodeRanges.All);
                });
        }

The method cannot be overridden. It is not virtual, and there is no way to override current behavior by inheritance.
And, the method is default builder of Ocelot pipeline while calling the `AddOcelot`_ method.
As alternative, to "override" this default builder, you can design and reuse custom builder as a ``Func<IMvcCoreBuilder, Assembly, IMvcCoreBuilder>`` delegate object 
and pass it as parameter to the `AddOcelotUsingBuilder`_ extension method.
It gives you full control on design and buiding of Ocelot pipeline, but be careful while designing your custom Ocelot pipeline as customizable ASP.NET MVC pipeline.

Warning! Most of services from minimal part of the pipeline should be reused, but only a few of services could be removed.

Warning!! The method above is called after adding required services of ASP.NET MVC pipeline building by 
`AddMvcCore <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.mvccoreservicecollectionextensions.addmvccore>`_ method 
over the ``Services`` property in upper calling context. These services are absolute minimum core services for ASP.NET MVC pipeline.
They must be added to DI container always, and they are added implicitly before calling of the method by caller in upper context.
So, ``AddMvcCore`` creates an ``IMvcCoreBuilder`` object with its assignment to the ``MvcCoreBuilder`` property.
Finally, as a default builder, the method above receives ``IMvcCoreBuilder`` object being ready for further extensions.

The next section shows you an example of designing custom Ocelot pipeline by custom builder.

Configuration Overview
----------------------

*Dependency Injection* for the :doc:`../features/configuration` feature in Ocelot is designed to extend and/or control **the configuration** of Ocelot kernel before the stage of building ASP.NET MVC pipeline services.

To configure the Ocelot pipeline and services, use the :ref:`di-configuration-extensions` in the following ``ConfigureAppConfiguration`` method (located in *Program.cs* and *Startup.cs*) of your minimal web app:

.. code-block:: csharp

    namespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
    public interface IWebHostBuilder
    {
        IWebHostBuilder ConfigureAppConfiguration(Action<WebHostBuilderContext, IConfigurationBuilder> configureDelegate);
    }

.. _di-configuration-extensions:

``IConfigurationBuilder`` extensions
------------------------------------

    | **Namespace**: ``Ocelot.DependencyInjection``
    | **Class**: `ConfigurationBuilderExtensions`_

The main methods are the :ref:`di-configuration-addocelot` within the `ConfigurationBuilderExtensions`_ class.
This method has a list of overloaded versions with corresponding signatures.

The purpose of this method is to prepare everything before actually configuring with native extensions. It involves the following steps:

1. **Merging Partial JSON Files**: The ``GetMergedOcelotJson`` method merges partial JSON files.
2. **Selecting Merge Type**: It allows you to choose a merge type to save the merged JSON configuration data either ``ToFile`` or ``ToMemory``.
3. **Framework Extensions**: Finally, the method calls the following native ``IConfigurationBuilder`` framework extensions:

   * The ``AddJsonFile`` method adds the primary configuration file (commonly known as `ocelot.json`_) after the merge stage. It writes the file back **to the file system** using the ``ToFile`` merge type option, which is implicitly the default.
   * The ``AddJsonStream`` method adds the JSON data of the primary configuration file as a UTF-8 stream **into memory** after the merge stage. It uses the ``ToMemory`` merge type option.

.. _di-configuration-addocelot:

``AddOcelot`` methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Signatures** of the most common versions:

.. code-block:: csharp

    IConfigurationBuilder AddOcelot(this IConfigurationBuilder builder, IWebHostEnvironment env);
    IConfigurationBuilder AddOcelot(this IConfigurationBuilder builder, string folder, IWebHostEnvironment env);

**Note**: These versions use the implicit ``ToFile`` merge type to write `ocelot.json`_ back to disk. Finally, they call the ``AddJsonFile`` extension.

**Signatures** of the versions to specify a ``MergeOcelotJson`` option:

.. code-block:: csharp

    IConfigurationBuilder AddOcelot(this IConfigurationBuilder builder, IWebHostEnvironment env, MergeOcelotJson mergeTo,
        string primaryConfigFile = null, string globalConfigFile = null, string environmentConfigFile = null, bool? optional = null, bool? reloadOnChange = null);
    IConfigurationBuilder AddOcelot(this IConfigurationBuilder builder, string folder, IWebHostEnvironment env, MergeOcelotJson mergeTo,
        string primaryConfigFile = null, string globalConfigFile = null, string environmentConfigFile = null, bool? optional = null, bool? reloadOnChange = null);

**Note**: These versions include optional arguments to specify the location of the three main files involved in the merge operation.
In theory, these files can be located anywhere, but in practice, it is better to keep them in one folder.

**Signatures** of the versions to indicate the ``FileConfiguration`` object of a self-created out-of-the-box configuration: [#f1]_

.. code-block:: csharp

    IConfigurationBuilder AddOcelot(this IConfigurationBuilder builder, FileConfiguration fileConfiguration,
        string primaryConfigFile = null, bool? optional = null, bool? reloadOnChange = null);
    IConfigurationBuilder AddOcelot(this IConfigurationBuilder builder, FileConfiguration fileConfiguration, IWebHostEnvironment env, MergeOcelotJson mergeTo,
        string primaryConfigFile = null, string globalConfigFile = null, string environmentConfigFile = null, bool? optional = null, bool? reloadOnChange = null);

| **Note 1**: These versions include optional arguments to specify the location of the three main files involved in the merge operation.
| **Note 2**: Your ``FileConfiguration`` object can be serialized/deserialized from anywhere: local or remote storage, Consul KV storage, and even a database.
