Logging
=======

  | MS Learn: `Logging in .NET Core and ASP.NET Core`_
  | Interfaces: `ILoggerFactory <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.iloggerfactory>`_ and `ILogger<T> <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger-1>`_

Ocelot uses the standard ASP.NET Core logging interfaces ``ILoggerFactory`` and ``ILogger<T>`` at the moment.
This is encapsulated in `IOcelotLogger <https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/blob/main/src/Ocelot/Logging/IOcelotLogger.cs>`_ and `IOcelotLoggerFactory <https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/blob/main/src/Ocelot/Logging/IOcelotLoggerFactory.cs>`_ with the implementation for the standard `ASP.NET Core logging <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/>`_ stuff at the moment.
This is because Ocelot adds some extra info to the logs such as :ref:`lg-request-id` if it is configured.

There is a global :doc:`../features/errorcodes` :ref:`eh-middleware` that catches any exceptions thrown and logs them as errors.
Finally, if logging is set to the ``Trace`` level, Ocelot will log the start, finish, and any middlewares that throw an exception, which can be quite useful.

.. _lg-warning:

Warning
-------

If you are logging to the MS `Console <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.console>`_, you will experience terrible performance.
The community has encountered many performance issues with Ocelot, and it is always related to the ``Debug`` logging level when logging to the console/terminal.

- **Warning**! Make sure you are logging to an appropriate destination/storage in the production environment!
- Use ``Error`` and ``Critical`` levels in the production environment!
- Use the ``Warning`` level in testing & staging environments!

These and other recommendations can be found below in the :ref:`lg-best-practices` section.

.. _lg-best-practices:

Best Practices
--------------

  Microsoft Learn complete reference: `Logging in .NET Core and ASP.NET Core`_

Our recommendations for achieving the best logging with Ocelot are as follows.

1. Ensure the minimum log level while `Configure logging <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/#configure-logging>`_.
   The minimum log level is set in the application's ``appsettings.json`` file.
   This level is defined in the ``Logging`` section, for example:

   .. code-block:: json

    {
      "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
          "Default": "Information",
          "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
        }
      }
    }

   Whether you are using `Serilog`_ or the standard Microsoft providers, the logging configuration will be retrieved from this section.

   .. code-block:: csharp
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    builder.Configuration
        .SetBasePath(builder.Environment.ContentRootPath)
        .AddJsonFile($"appsettings.{builder.Environment.EnvironmentName}.json", false, false) // read logging settings of the environment
        .AddOcelot(builder.Environment);

   However, there is one thing to be aware of. It is possible to use the ``SetMinimumLevel()`` method to define the minimum logging level.
   Be careful and make sure you set the log level in only one place, like this:

   .. code-block:: csharp

    builder.Logging
        .ClearProviders()
        .SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Warning);
    // MS Console for Development and/or Testing environments only
    if (!builder.Environment.IsProduction())
    {
        builder.Logging.AddConsole();
    }

   Please also use the ``ClearProviders()`` method so that only the providers you wish to use are taken into account, such as the console in the example above.

2. Ensure the proper usage of the minimum logging level for each environment: development, testing, production, etc.
   So, once again, read the important notes in the :ref:`lg-warning` section!

3. Ocelot's logging has been improved in version `22.0`_:
   it is now possible to use a factory method for message strings that will only be executed if the minimum log level allows it.

   For example, let's take a message containing information about several variables that should only be generated if the minimum log level is ``Debug``.
   If the minimum log level is ``Warning``, then the string is never generated.

   Therefore, when the string contains dynamic information (e.g., ``string.Format``), or the string value is generated by a `string interpolation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/string-interpolation>`_ expression,
   it is recommended to call the ``LogX`` method using an anonymous delegate via an ``=>`` expression function:

   .. code-block:: csharp

    Logger.LogDebug(
        () => $"Downstream template is {httpContext.Items.DownstreamRoute().DownstreamPathTemplate.Value}");

   otherwise a constant string is sufficient

   .. code-block:: csharp

    Logger.LogDebug("My const string");

.. _lg-request-id:

Request ID
----------

  Also known as "Correlation ID" or `HttpContext.TraceIdentifier <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httpcontext.traceidentifier>`_

Ocelot allows a client to send a *Request ID* through an HTTP header.
If provided, Ocelot uses the *Request ID* for logging as soon as it becomes available in the middleware pipeline.
Additionally, Ocelot forwards the *Request ID* via the specified header to the downstream service.

  * You can still obtain the ASP.NET Core *Request ID* in the logs if you set ``IncludeScopes`` to ``true`` in your logging configuration.
  * The reason for not just using the `bog standard <https://notoneoffbritishisms.com/2015/03/27/bog-standard/>`_ framework logging is that
    we could not work out how to override the ``RequestId`` that gets logged when setting ``IncludeScopes`` to ``true`` in the logging settings.
    Nicely onto the next feature.

Every log record has these 2 properties:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 25 75
  :header-rows: 1

  * - *Property*
    - *Description*
  * - ``RequestId``
    - This represents ID of the current request as plain string, for example ``0HMVD33IIJRFR:00000001``
  * - ``PreviousRequestId``
    - This represents ID of the previous request

.. _break: http://break.do

  As an ``IOcelotLogger`` interface object is injected into the constructors of service classes, the current default Ocelot logger (``OcelotLogger`` class) reads these two properties from the ``IRequestScopedDataRepository`` interface object.

Find out more about these properties and other details on the *Request ID* logging feature below.

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to use the *Request ID* feature, you have two options: specifying it globally or for the route.

In your `ocelot.json`_, set the following configuration in the ``GlobalConfiguration`` section.
This setting will apply to all requests processed by Ocelot.

.. code-block:: json

  "GlobalConfiguration": {
    "RequestIdKey": "Oc-RequestId"
  }

.. _break: http://break.do

  We recommend using the ``GlobalConfiguration`` unless it is absolutely necessary to make it route-specific.

If you want to override this for a specific route, add the following to `ocelot.json`_:

.. code-block:: json

  "RequestIdKey": "Oc-RequestId"

Once Ocelot identifies incoming requests that match a route, it will set the *Request ID* based on the route configuration.

Problem
^^^^^^^

This can lead to a small issue.
If you set a ``GlobalConfiguration``, it is possible to use one *Request ID* until the route is identified and then another afterward, as the *Request ID* key can change.
This behavior is intentional and represents the best solution we have devised for now.
In this case, the ``OcelotLogger`` will display both the current *Request ID* and the previous *Request ID* in the logs.

Below is an example of the logging when the ``Debug`` level is set for a normal request:

.. Note by Maintainer:
..   The PreviousRequestId feature requires review and possible redesign, as it may not be implemented or could be broken.
..   Typically, PreviousRequestId is '-' for all requests.

Technical Facts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Every log record has these 2 properties:

  * ``RequestId`` represents ID of the current request as plain string, for example ``0HNBA3NEIQUNJ:00000001``.
  * ``PreviousRequestId`` represents ID of the previous request.
* As an ``IOcelotLogger`` interface object is injected into the constructors of service classes, the current default Ocelot logger (the ``OcelotLogger`` class) retrieves these two properties from the ``IRequestScopedDataRepository`` service.

.. _lg-performance:

Performance [#f1]_
------------------

Here is a quick recipe for your production environment to achieve top *performance*.
You need to ensure the minimum log level is ``Critical`` or ``None``. Nothing more!
Having top logging *performance* means having fewer log records written by the logging provider. So, the logs should be pretty empty.

Anyway, during the initial period after a version release to production, we recommend monitoring the system and the current version's app behavior by specifying the minimum log level as ``Error``.
If the release engineer ensures the stability of the version in production, then the minimum log level can be increased to ``Critical`` or ``None`` to achieve top *performance*.
Technically, this will disable the logging feature entirely.

Benchmarks
----------

We currently have two types of benchmarks:

- ``SerilogBenchmarks`` with `Serilog`_ logging to a file. See the ``ConfigureLogging`` method with ``logging.AddSerilog(_logger)``.
- ``MsLoggerBenchmarks`` with MS default logging to the MS Console. See the ``ConfigureLogging`` method with ``logging.AddConsole()``.

Benchmark results largely depend on the environment and hardware on which they run.
We are pleased to invite you to run logging benchmarks on your machine by following the instructions below.

1. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt console
2. Build the Ocelot solution in Release mode: ``dotnet build --configuration Release``
3. Go to the ``test\Ocelot.Benchmarks\bin\Release\`` folder
4. Choose the .NET version by changing the folder, for example, to ``net9.0``
5. Run benchmarks: ``.\Ocelot.Benchmarks.exe``
6. Run ``SerilogBenchmarks`` or ``MsLoggerBenchmarks`` by pressing the appropriate number of a benchmark (5 or 6), then press Enter.
7. Wait for 3+ minutes to complete the benchmark and get the final results.
8. Read and analyze your benchmark session results.
