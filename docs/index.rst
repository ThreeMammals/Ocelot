Welcome to Ocelot `23.1 <https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/releases/tag/23.1.0>`_
======================================================================================

Thanks for taking a look at the Ocelot documentation! Please use the left hand navigation to get around.
The team would suggest taking a look at the **Introduction** chapter first.

All **Features** are arranged in alphabetical order.
The main features are :doc:`../features/configuration` and :doc:`../features/routing`.

We **do** follow development process which is described in :doc:`../building/releaseprocess`.
