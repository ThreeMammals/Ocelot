Quality of Service
==================

    Label: `QoS <https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/labels/QoS>`_

Ocelot supports one QoS capability at the current time. You can set on a per Route basis if you want to use a circuit breaker when making requests to a downstream service.
This uses an awesome .NET library called `Polly`_, check them out `in official repository <https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly>`_.

The first thing you need to do if you want to use the :doc:`../features/administration` API is bring in the relevant NuGet `package <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ocelot.Provider.Polly>`_:

.. code-block:: powershell

    Install-Package Ocelot.Provider.Polly

Then in your ``ConfigureServices`` method to add `Polly`_ services we must call the ``AddPolly()`` extension of the ``OcelotBuilder`` being returned by ``AddOcelot()`` [#f1]_ like below:

.. code-block:: csharp

    services.AddOcelot()
        .AddPolly();

Then add the following section to a Route configuration: 

.. code-block:: json

  "QoSOptions": {
    "ExceptionsAllowedBeforeBreaking": 3,
    "DurationOfBreak": 1000,
    "TimeoutValue": 5000
  }

- You must set a number equal or greater than ``2`` against **ExceptionsAllowedBeforeBreaking** for this rule to be implemented. [#f2]_
- **DurationOfBreak** means the circuit breaker will stay open for 1 second after it is tripped.
- **TimeoutValue** means if a request takes more than 5 seconds, it will automatically be timed out. 

You can set the **TimeoutValue** in isolation of the **ExceptionsAllowedBeforeBreaking** and **DurationOfBreak** options:

.. code-block:: json

  "QoSOptions": {
    "TimeoutValue": 5000
  }

There is no point setting the other two in isolation as they affect each other!

Notes
-----

1. If you do not add a QoS section, QoS will not be used, however Ocelot will default to a **90** seconds timeout on all downstream requests. If someone needs this to be configurable, open an issue. [#f2]_

2. `Polly`_ V7 syntax no longer supported. In version `23.2`_ [#f3]_ with `Polly`_ version 8+, the ``ExceptionsAllowedBeforeBreaking`` value must be equal to or greater than **2**!

Extensibility [#f3]_
--------------------

If you want to use your ``ResiliencePipeline<T>`` provider, you can use the following syntax:

.. code-block:: csharp

    services.AddOcelot()
        .AddPolly<MyProvider>();
   // MyProvider should implement IPollyQoSResiliencePipelineProvider<HttpResponseMessage> 
   // Note: you can use standard provider PollyQoSResiliencePipelineProvider

If, in addition, you want to use your own ``DelegatingHandler``, you can use the following syntax:

.. code-block:: csharp

    services.AddOcelot()
        .AddPolly<MyProvider>(MyQosDelegatingHandlerDelegate);
   // MyProvider should implement IPollyQoSResiliencePipelineProvider<HttpResponseMessage> 
   // Note: you can use standard provider PollyQoSResiliencePipelineProvider
   // MyQosDelegatingHandlerDelegate is a delegate use to get a DelegatingHandler

And finally, if you want to define your own set of exceptions to map, you can use the following syntax:

.. code-block:: csharp

    services.AddOcelot()
        .AddPolly<MyProvider>(MyErrorMapping);
    // MyProvider should implement IPollyQoSResiliencePipelineProvider<HttpResponseMessage> 
    // Note: you can use standard provider PollyQoSResiliencePipelineProvider

    // MyErrorMapping is a Dictionary<Type, Func<Exception, Error>>, eg:
    private static readonly Dictionary<Type, Func<Exception, Error>> MyErrorMapping = new()
    {
        {typeof(TaskCanceledException), CreateError},
        {typeof(TimeoutRejectedException), CreateError},
        {typeof(BrokenCircuitException), CreateError},
        {typeof(BrokenCircuitException<HttpResponseMessage>), CreateError},
    };
    private static Error CreateError(Exception e) => new RequestTimedOutError(e);

.. [#f1] :ref:`di-the-addocelot-method` adds default ASP.NET services to DI container. You could call another extended :ref:`di-addocelotusingbuilder-method` while configuring services to develop your own :ref:`di-custom-builder`. See more instructions in the ":ref:`di-addocelotusingbuilder-method`" section of :doc:`../features/dependencyinjection` feature.
