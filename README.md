## About
Ocelot is a .NET [API gateway](https://www.bing.com/search?q=API+gateway).
This project is aimed at people using .NET running a microservices (service-oriented) architecture that needs a unified point of entry into their system.
However, it will work with anything that speaks HTTP(S) and runs on any platform that [ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) supports.

<!--
In particular we want easy integration with [IdentityServer](https://github.com/IdentityServer) reference and [Bearer](https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/) tokens. 
We have been unable to find this in our current workplace without having to write our own Javascript middlewares to handle the IdentityServer reference tokens.
We would rather use the IdentityServer code that already exists to do this.
-->

Ocelot consists of a series of ASP.NET Core [middlewares](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/) arranged in a specific order.

Ocelot [custom middlewares](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/write) manipulate the `HttpRequest` object into a state specified by its configuration until it reaches a request builder middleware, where it creates a `HttpRequestMessage` object, which is used to make a request to a downstream service.
The middleware that makes the request is the last thing in the Ocelot pipeline. It does not call the next middleware.
The response from the downstream service is retrieved as the request goes back up the Ocelot pipeline.
There is a piece of middleware that maps the `HttpResponseMessage` onto the `HttpResponse` object, and that is returned to the client.
That is basically it, with a bunch of other features!

### Notes
[^1]: Ocelot does not directly support [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). Developers can easily integrate the [GraphQL for .NET](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet) library. 
[^2]: Ocelot supports the following service discovery providers: (**1**) [Consul](https://www.consul.io) through the [Ocelot.Provider.Consul](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ocelot.Provider.Consul) extension package, (**2**) [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) via the [Ocelot.Provider.Kubernetes](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ocelot.Provider.Kubernetes) extension package, and (**3**) [Netflix Eureka](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-netflix), which utilizes the [Steeltoe.Discovery.Eureka](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Steeltoe.Discovery.Eureka) package referenced within the [Ocelot.Provider.Eureka](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ocelot.Provider.Eureka) extension package. Additionally, Ocelot supports (**4**) Azure [Service Fabric](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/service-fabric/) for service discovery, along with special modes such as [Dynamic Routing](https://ocelot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/servicediscovery.html#dynamic-routing) and [Custom Providers](https://ocelot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/servicediscovery.html#custom-providers).
[^3]: Retry policies only via [Polly](https://github.com//App-vNext/Polly) library referenced within the [Ocelot.Provider.Polly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ocelot.Provider.Polly) extension package.
[^4]: Starting with version [21](https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/releases/tag/21.0.0) and higher, the solution's code base supports [Multitargeting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-multitargeting-overview) as SDK-style projects. It should be easier for teams to migrate to the currently supported [.NET 8 and 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle) frameworks. Also, new features will be available for all .NET SDKs that we support via multitargeting. Find out more here: [Target frameworks in SDK-style projects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/frameworks)
[^5]: [Ocelot Guru](https://gurubase.io/g/ocelot) is an unofficial tool to get answers regarding Ocelot: please consider it an advanced search tool. Thus, we have an official [Questions & Answers](https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/discussions/categories/q-a) category in the [Discussions](https://github.com/ThreeMammals/Ocelot/discussions) space.
